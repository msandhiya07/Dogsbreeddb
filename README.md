Dog Breeds Around The World Dataset
This repository contains a dataset of dog breeds from various regions around the world. It provides valuable information about different breeds, their origins, and other related characteristics. The dataset is ideal for various applications, including breed identification, data analysis, machine learning model training, and pet-related studies.

Dataset Overview
The dataset Dog Breeds Around The World.csv contains the following columns:

breed: The name of the dog breed (e.g., Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd).
origin: The country or region where the breed originated (e.g., USA, Germany, France).
group: The classification of the breed based on the AKC (American Kennel Club) or other standards (e.g., Sporting, Working, Herding, Hound).
life_expectancy: The average lifespan of the breed in years.
height: The typical height range of the breed (in centimeters or inches).
weight: The average weight range of the breed (in kilograms or pounds).
coat_type: The type of coat the breed typically has (e.g., Short, Long, Curly, Wiry).
activity_level: The general activity level of the breed (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
temperament: The general temperament of the breed (e.g., Friendly, Intelligent, Independent, Playful).
Getting Started
To get started with the dataset, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/msandhiya07/Dogsbreeddb.git
Prerequisites
To work with the dataset and run analyses, you will need Python and some libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
Usage
You can use this dataset for various purposes:

Dog Breed Classification: Build models to classify dog breeds based on features such as weight, height, or temperament.
Breed Comparisons: Analyze different characteristics of dog breeds, such as life expectancy, activity level, and size.
Visualization: Create visualizations to compare the distribution of dog breeds across different groups, countries of origin, or other attributes.
Example: Visualizing Dog Breed Life Expectancy by Group
Hereâ€™s an example of how you might visualize the average life expectancy of dog breeds by group using Python and matplotlib:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('Dog Breeds Around The World.csv')

# Group by breed group and calculate the average life expectancy
avg_life_expectancy = data.groupby('group')['life_expectancy'].mean()

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
avg_life_expectancy.sort_values().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Average Life Expectancy by Dog Breed Group')
plt.xlabel('Breed Group')
plt.ylabel('Average Life Expectancy (Years)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
Dependencies
To work with the dataset, you can use the following Python libraries:

pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib - for plotting graphs
seaborn - for statistical data visualization
numpy - for numerical operations
